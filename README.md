## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

***
```
var colors: Array = ["orange","red","yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

print(colors[0] + ", " + colors[2] + ", and " + colors[4] + " are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

***
```
var westernStates: Array = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]

westernStates.remove(at: 4)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)

print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`
***
```
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]

for i in moreStates {
if i == "Hawaii" || i == "Alaska" {
print(i + ": yes")
}
else {
print(i + ": no")
}
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`
***
```
var notSpace = 0
for i in myFavoriteQuotes {
for n in i {
if n != " " {
notSpace += 1
}
}
}
print(notSpace)
```


## Question 5 - todo

Iterate through `garden` and place any 🌷 that you find into the `basket`. Replace any 🌷 that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many 🌷 are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt","dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
let flower = "🌷"
let dirt = "dirt"

for (i, j) in garden.enumerated() {
if j == flower {
basket.append(j)
garden[i] = "dirt"
}
j.replacingOccurrences(of: flower, with: dirt)
}

print(basket.count)
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`
***
```
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]
battingLineup += ["Suzuki"]
battingLineup[1] = "Tejade"
battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"
battingLineup.remove(at: 0)
battingLineup += ["Reyes"]
print (battingLineup)
```


## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```
var numbers = [56,79,34,25,64,32]

let target: Int = 32

for i in numbers {
if i == target {
print("true")
} else {
print("false")
}
}

```



## Question 8 -?

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

for i in arrayOfNumbers where i > maxNum  {
maxNum = i
}
print(maxNum)
```

## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`
***
```
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]
var oddNum = ""

for i in secondListOfNumbers where i % 2 == 1 {
oddNum += "\(i) "
}
print(oddNum)
```


## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
***
```
var sum = (Int)()
for i in thirdListOfNumbers {
sum += i
}
print(sum)

thirdListOfNumbers.reduce(0, +)
```


## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
***
```var evenSum = 0

for i in thirdListOfNumbers {
if i % 2 == 0 {
evenSum += i
}
}

print(evenSum)
```


## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
for x in listOne {
for y in listTwo {
if x == y {
sharedElements.append(n)

}
}
}
print(sharedElements)
```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
for i in dupeList where noDupeList.contains(i) != true {
noDupeList.append(i)
}
print(noDupeList)
```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`
***
```
let arraySort = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
let secondSmall = arrayOfNumbers[1]
print(secondSmall)
```


## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
***
```
let natNumRange = 1..<1000
var multipleSum = 0

for i in natNumRange where i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
multipleSum += i
}
print(multipleSum)
```

## Question 17

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.
